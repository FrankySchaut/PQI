# Privacy Limitation Statement — PQI v0.2
Part of The Architecture of Limitation in Code

PQI processes *relevance* (S,G,C) — not identity. No storage, no network calls, no telemetry. Inputs are ephemeral, numeric features; outputs are contextual metrics (score + verdict). See CALIBRATION for philosophy; see tools/ for local audits.
