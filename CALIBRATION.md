# PQI v0.2 — Calibration Deck
Use these prompts to sanity-check scoring and demonstrate behaviour. Ranges are indicative (±5–10 points).

| # | Prompt | Expected PQI | Why |
|---|-------|---------------|-----|
| 1 | Explain AI. | 35–50 | Minimal context/completeness/reflection. Clarity okay. |
| 2 | How might we redesign hiring prompts to reduce bias while preserving intent? | 70–85 | Strong completeness, proportion, reflection; neutral tone. |
| 3 | I wonder: what if every prompt were a moral act shaping shared cognition? | 80–92 | High reflection; good clarity; proportion balanced. |
| 4 | Summarize this job description. | 40–55 | Low context & reflection; average clarity. |
| 5 | Compare three approaches to onboarding that improve time-to-value without increasing burnout. | 68–80 | Good completeness/context; fairness neutral; proportion okay. |
| 6 | Everyone must follow this obviously perfect process or they fail. | 30–50 | Absolutist language hits fairness; reflection low. |
| 7 | Describe, in two paragraphs, how to measure customer success leading indicators for a post-Series A B2B SaaS. | 60–75 | Clear scope, context; moderate reflection; neutral sentiment. |
| 8 | If we treat prompt design as a boundary condition for shared cognition, what constraints keep meaning proportional? | 78–88 | High reflection; good completeness; proportion decent. |
| 9 | Draft a brief, fair performance summary that balances achievements and growth areas, avoiding loaded language. | 72–85 | Fairness strong; clarity/completeness solid; reflection moderate. |
|10 | Can you analyze risks, propose mitigations, and outline a test plan; then suggest a smaller pilot if resources are limited? | 70–82 | Strong completeness/structure; decent context; neutral fairness. |
